Folder's purpose to contain model output; however, our model files are too large for storage. The notebooks should create several pickle files with our model outputs, below are the details:

	Location_Predictions_lr_model.pkl is the pickle file containing Linear Regression Model Results 
 	for the location model.
 
	Location_Predictions_rf_model.pkl is the pickle file containing Random Forest Model Results 
 	for the location model.
 
	Location_Predictions_xgb_model,pkl is the pickle file containing XG Boost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) Model Results
 	for the location model.

  	Flag_Predictions_lr_model.pkl is the pickle file containing Linear Regression Model Results 
 	for the flag model.
 
	Flag_Predictions_rf_model.zip is the pickle file containing Random Forest Model Results 
 	for the flag model.
 
	Flag_Predictions_xgb_model,pkl is the pickle file containing XG Boost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) Model Results
 	for the flag model.
