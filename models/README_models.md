Folder's purpose to contain model output, the contents of the folder is listed below:

	lr_model.pkl is the pickle file (sklearn 1.3.2) containing Linear Regression Model Results 
 	for the vessel location model.
 
	rf_model.pkl is the pickle file (sklearn 1.3.2) containing Random Forest Model Results 
 	for the vessel location model.
 
	xgb_model.pkl is the pickle file (sklearn 1.3.2) containing XG Boost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) Model Results
 	for the vessel location model.

  	lr_model2.pkl is the pickle file (sklearn 1.4.2) containing Linear Regression Model Results
